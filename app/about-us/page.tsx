                It started with a simple question: `&quot;`Why do businesses
                lose customers they could easily save?`&quot;` After seeing
                countless restaurants, salons, and retail stores struggle with
                silent dissatisfaction, our founders knew there had to be a
                better way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditional feedback systems were broken. Customers would leave
                unhappy, never to return, while businesses remained completely
                unaware of what went wrong. We set out to bridge this gap with
                intelligent automation that not only captures feedback but acts
                on it instantly.
