      question: "Is the software HIPAA compliant?",
      answer:
        "Yes, absolutely. We maintain strict HIPAA compliance with end-to-end encryption, secure data storage, and regular security audits. All patient data is protected according to healthcare privacy regulations.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the integration work with my existing software?",
      answer:
        "Our software integrates seamlessly with popular practice management systems like Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Open Dental, and others through secure API connections. Setup typically takes less than 5 minutes.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if my staff isn't tech-savvy?",
      answer:
        "No technical knowledge required! Our software runs automatically in the background. We provide free onboarding and training, plus 24/7 support. Most practices are up and running in under an hour.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly will I see results?",
      answer:
        "Most practices see their first recovered appointments within 48 hours of activation. Full ROI is typically achieved within the first month as the automation optimizes based on your practice's patterns.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if patients don't respond to the automated messages?",
      answer:
        "Our system uses intelligent sequencing and multiple touchpoints (email, SMS, voice) to maximize response rates. We achieve an average 65% recovery rate, but even recovering just 2-3 appointments per month covers the software cost.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the messages sent to patients?",
      answer:
        "Yes, all messages can be fully customized to match your practice's tone and branding. You can set different messages for different types of appointments and personalize based on patient history.",
    },
